General comments
----------------------------------------

This is an interesting project, and it was
well-executed. The writeup was clear and
understandable, with the intuitive reasoning
for various analysis choices well-explained.

I would like to suggest two areas for improvement.
First, the code could've been written in
a slightly more general way. In particular,
the parties were hardcoded, making it fairly
labour intensive to generalized the code if
(say) a new party becomes relevant in future elections.

The other suggestion is regarding the
weights you used (e.g., for different years
and the 50/50 weights for H vs P). You came
up with some good reasoning for choosing the
weights that you did. To take this to the next
level, however, what you can do is to pretend
that the 2018 election hasn't happened yet, and
to try to use the historical data to predict
the 2018 results. Comparing your prediction
to the results then allows you to calibrate
your weights appropriately. In other words, you
can treat this like a two-step regression problem.
First you use 2018 as "data" to help you figure
out the best-fit values for the weights in your
model. Then you fix those weights and throw
in all the data to help you figure out what will
happen in 2022.

It was a real pleasure having you in the class
this term! Best of luck, and I hope you have an
enjoyable and restful summer!

Best,
Adrian
